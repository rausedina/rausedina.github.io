                          <p>I started watching Mark near 2016 after Sister Location came out. I dont remember the date but he appeared in my reccomended and I was like " oh he seems cool" and here I am..
                       Mark has been a significant part of my life after I first started watching him. I have been phasing in and out of my Markiplier phase but I do watch him everyday and he has become part of my daily routine. Aside from that he has helped me a lot especially during quarantine. I am so happy to watch him and I am so happy he is doing well and making such amazing projects such as In Space with Markiplier, Heist with Markiplier and more.  </p>

                               I started it because I was bored and it ended up being a massive phase. I was bored dring quarantine i think May 2020 or something and I was like "Why not start One Piece?" and It just siprals down to choas and a massive rabbit hole. I caught up in 2 months and started reading the manga and have been watching the episodes too. Though I lost my interest at around the end of 2020 and 2021 ( I don't remember correctly cause I was watchingepisode 210 and in the comment section I found a commment that I wrote and it said it was <b> 3</b> years ago? Perhaps i started it 2019? I dont remember though. My One PIece phase came bac after I found out my uncle liked One Piece. I consumed so much One Piece content and my phase came back ( i bought a Luffy cosplay too)</br></br></br></br>
